# PHSX815_Project3

Finding the most likely weight of a coin being tossed using a simulated data set

## Bernoulli.py

performs the simulated experiment and outputs as 'output.txt'

can alter weight of coin and number of tosses

## Analysis.py

Plots a function proportional to the likelyhood

function uses weight of coin as a parameter

So far, the code plots said function

## Next Steps

### Add code that finds the maximum value for the function

Perhaps write a second function that takes (1-likelyhood) and run a minimizer on this function?

### Add error bars using variance

Currently function plots near continuously, error bars need to be for specific values
